<h1>Pharmacy Feud</h1>

<div>
    <p>
        I use this program as a "framing device" during lectures.   If you watch Family Feud, you'll notice that there
        is actually very little time devoted to the game.   Some have stated that each 1/2 hour show only has
        3 minutes of actual gameplay. Similarly, I use the time between students giving answers to talk about the
        responses that have come up on the board and how they relate to the topic of the lecture.
    </p>
    <p>
        The original version I wrote for myself made an AJAX call to the server to retrieve data with which to populate
        the board. To simplify use by other institutions, this version looks for a file in the "gameData" folder
        containing the JSON needed. There are examples in the folder.  To create your own questions, just create
        new javascript files in that folder using the ones already there as models. They are just text files and
        you can edit them in Notepad.   Give the new question file a unique name and make sure that when you save it
        the extension is "<b>.js</b>" (not ".txt" or ".html").
    </p>

    <p>
        While this software runs in a browser, there is no need to host it on a server.   It will run very happily
        from a local folder on your hard drive.   You <b>will need an Internet connection</b> to run the game.
        The program needs to retrieve some javascript libraries and can't do it if there is no Internet connection.
    </p>

    <p>
        To load the game data, use the same URL you used to open this file, but add the gameData variable to the URL,
        e.g.,
    </p>

    <p>
        <code><a href='index.html?gameData=medicaid'>index.html?gameData=medicaid</a></code>
    </p>
    <p>
        <code><a href='index.html?gameData=std'>index.html?gameData=std</a></code>
    </p>
    <p>
        <code><a href='index.html?gameData=freak'>index.html?gameData=freak</a></code>
    </p>
    <p>
        <code><a href='index.html?gameData=bore'>index.html?gameData=bore</a></code>
    </p>
</div>

<div>
    <p>The game board will open in another window that is sized correctly. If you load the page and nothing happens,
        <li>Make you aren't covering up the game board with another window</li>
        <li>Make sure your browser is not blocking popup windows</li>
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <p>Before playing the game, make sure that the new window has focus. That is, click somewhere on the window with
        your mouse to make sure that window is 'active'.
</div>
<div>
    <p>
        Rather than have a team of students stand up in front of the room the entire time, I usually pit "left side
        of the room"  versus "right side of the room".
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <p>I usually start the game by having two students from either side of the room stand next to a wireless keyboard
        sitting on a box
        in front of the screen at the front of the auditorium. The SPACEBAR is
        the button for Team 1 to ring-in. The ENTER key is the ring-in button for Team 2. Sometimes I'll put a little
        piece of Post-It note on the keys to make it more obvious.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <p>Whoever rings in first locks out the other player. So, it's not necessary to guess who clicked first.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <p>From there, I control the board using a small wireless keyboard I can carry around the auditorium.  I just pick
    somewhere random and have students sitting in their seats make guesses.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <ul>
        <li>Number keys 1 - 8 reveal the answers</li>
        <li>The 0 (zero) key cycles through the number of strikes. That is, it shows one strike the first time
            it is pressed, two strikes the second time and three strikes the third time.
        </li>
        <li>The 9 key always plays a single strike. This is for incorrect answers during the face-off and when
            a team tries to steal.
        </li>
        <li>At the end, click on the score of whichever team won that round. The points from up top will be
            transferred to their score.
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div>
    <p>Scores from the previous round are carried over to subsequent rounds. If you need to clear out the team scores,
        close all browser windows.</p>
</div>

<div>
    <p>While I do not believe my use of sound files and images infringes on anyone's copyright, if it does let me know
     and I will take down the offending material.</p>
